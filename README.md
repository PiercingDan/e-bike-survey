# City of Toronto e-bike Survey 

Machine learning on the [City of Toronto e-bike survey](https://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=b3fc9ba6aa360410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=7807e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD).

### Questions to Consider

Which models did we consider? Which Model did we choose and why? How good was it?

What was the pattern of missing values? Was it random? Could those be inferred from the context?

Which features were significant in predicting the target response?

If we could re-design the survey for next year, what question(s) would we add or remove in order to improve the precision of the prediction?
